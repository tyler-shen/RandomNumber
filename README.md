This is a coding practice I got in job hunting. If you are doing the same interview, I suggest you do not use my code because I didn't pass the interview lol

Create Random Number List

It generates and prints out a list of 10,000 numbers in random order each time it is run. Each number in the list is unique and be between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive).

You can double click on the RandomNumber.exe file to see the result.

You can also open the RandomNumber.sln project to see the source code in C# with Visual Studio, or open the Program.cs file with any IDE you like, and change the "length" variable in the Main program if you want.

Thank you
